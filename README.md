Select the corresponding number to chose your product.  You will then be prompted to input the amount of the product you would like to purchase. A prompt asking if this is the correct amount will pop up.  Input Y for yes and N for no. It is important that you are positive this is the correct amount as the order will placed and you will not be able to cancel it.  If your order is correct and there is enough available stock to complete your order you will be notified of total amount and the order will be entered.
